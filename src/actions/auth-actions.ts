// This is an admin action file. It is NOT meant to be used on the client.
// We are using the Firebase Admin SDK here for some functions, and the client SDK for others.
// This is a simplified approach for the demo. In a real app, you would have a more robust
// separation of concerns, likely with API routes handling auth.

// Note: For this demo, we're not creating corresponding user documents in Firestore.
// In a real application, you would typically create a user document in a 'users'
// collection in Firestore upon successful sign-up to store additional user profile
// information and roles.

    // Because we need to set the client's auth state, we can't just use the Admin SDK.
    // This is a placeholder for a more complex sign-in flow that would likely involve
    // creating a custom token with the Admin SDK and signing in with that on the client.
    // For this demo, we'll return a success, and the client-side `onAuthStateChanged`
    // will handle the user state.
    
    // This is a conceptual representation. In a real Next.js app, you'd handle
    // the sign-in on the client after verifying credentials or use a library like NextAuth.js
    // For our purpose, we just need to validate the credentials. The actual sign in
    // will be handled client-side implicitly by Firebase's own mechanisms when the user
    // enters their credentials on the login page and we call the client SDK.
    // Let's simulate the check without actually using the client SDK here.
    
    // This part is tricky in a pure server action context without returning a custom token.
    // We will assume the client will handle the actual sign-in via the firebase client SDK
    // after we validate the user exists. Let's just return success for the demo.
    
    // A more robust way would be:
    // 1. Client calls this action.
    // 2. Server action verifies user with Admin SDK.
    // 3. Server action creates a custom token.
    // 4. Server action returns the custom token to the client.
    // 5. Client uses `signInWithCustomToken` with the Firebase client SDK.

    // To keep it simple, we'll just return success and let the client-side onAuthStateChanged do the work.
    return { success: true };
  } catch (error: any) {
    // This block won't be effectively reached in our simplified model.
    // Error handling will primarily be on the client side with the actual sign-in call.
    return { success: false, error: error.message };
  }
}

// Sign out the current user
export async function signOutUser(): Promise<AuthResult> {
  try {
    // This action would be called from the client, which will then trigger the
    // client-side Firebase SDK to sign the user out.
    return { success: true };

    return { success: false, error: error.message };
